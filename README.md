# rexx4eclipse

This is a REXX Editor based on the following Eclipse technologies
   
* [Eclipse LSP4E](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e) 
* [Eclipse TM4E - TextMate support in the Eclipse IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) 
* [Eclipse LSP4J](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4j) 

Based on the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) it is nowadays possible to create editor language support for different tools. One is therefore not tied in with a technology.

However I still prefer the Eclipse IDE for development and this project provides the syntax highlighting for REXX and the connectivity to a REXX language server with is implemented in [lsp4rexx](https://github.com/holzem/lsp4rexx).
